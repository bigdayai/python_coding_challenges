# Python Coding Challenges

This repo contains a variety of beginner, intermediate and advanced python coding challenges with throught process and solutions.

## Problem Solving Approach

I have a standard problem solving process that I can rely on for tackling any programming problem I encounter.\
The problem solving process generally follows these basic steps, which aren't necessarily linear.

### 1. Write about the problem

I start by writing about a problem to determine exactly what I need to get my code to do.\
Determine available input(s) and ideal output(s).

### 2. Record observations

I take a closer look at the problem and record my observations about limitations, requirements, a patterns.\
I often come back to this step while writing a pseudocode solutions and playing around with actually coding a solution.

### 3. Distill observations into rules & principles

A program is essentially our best approach for doing something, formalized in a way that a computer can understand and execute.\
Understanding the underlying rules and principles behind a problem and solution are essential for writing instructions.

### 4. Write a pseudocode solution

Pseudocode helps me pull further formalize a process into a step-by-step outline of how it will work.\
This gets me one step closer to the actual code and I usually go back and forth from this step and the next.

### 5. Code to solve the most challenging edge case

I want my code to solve for the most difficult edge case, so I can encompass it in my solution.\
I break the solution down into it's essential steps.

### 6. Wrap the solution into a function

I clean up my code and wrap it in a function so I can easily test it with other cases.

### 7. Test the function using other edge cases

I test the function and evaluate performance.  Does it give the desired output in a variety of scenarios?

### 8. Research other approaches & evaluate

Finally I research approaches developed by other programmers and compare their solutions to mine.\
I like to do this last when working with coding challenges so I can understand my approach.\
But this is often a good place to start when developing a program for a professioal purpose.
